# SimGPS
In order to generate some interesting animation for visualization and give a brief guideline for how GPS works, we decide to use [python](https://www.python.org/) to create a simulation environment.

## Requirements & Installation

### Environment

- Python 3.7

### Requirements

- numpy
- matplotlib

### Installation

`Conda` is recommended for python environment management:

```
conda create -n simgps python==3.7
conda activate simgps
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
